# trollfs
trolls your filesystem by remounting your rootfs as rw to /var/mobile/trollfs.

usage:
1. jailbreak (it will not work otherwise)
2. install app with trollstore
3. open app
4. click "troll my filesystem"
5. enjoy

I am not responsible for any damage that occurs to your system, including but not limited to:
1. panics
2. bootloops
3. bricks

Enjoy or something idk. I made this as a joke
It doesn't work unless you're jailbroken. It might work on Dopamine, I have no way to test. It works on 15.4.1 palera1n
