# trollfs
trolls your filesystem by remounting your rootfs as rw to /var/mobile/trollfs.

usage:
1. jailbreak (it will not work otherwise)
2. install app with trollstore
3. open app
4. click "troll my filesystem"
5. enjoy

All changes are temporary and will be reverted on a reboot (tested on 6s on 15.0.2).

If it gives you error 75 on trying to troll, close, wait a few seconds, reopen, click untroll and then troll

Enjoy or something idk. I made this as a joke
It doesn't work unless you're jailbroken with palera1n. it does not work with dopamine (error 77).
